assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> for_actual_with_percent 
	Expected [strlen("%d")] to [equal] [3]
		actual value:			[2]
		expected value:			[3]

assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> for_compare_area_to_null 
	Wanted to compare contents of [null_pointer] but it had a value of NULL.
		If you want to explicitly check for null, use the is_null constraint instead.

assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> for_compare_null_to_area 
	Wanted to compare contents with [area],
		but NULL was used for the pointer we wanted to compare to.
		If you want to explicitly check for null, use the is_null constraint instead.

assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> for_comparing_content_with_negative_length 
	Wanted to compare contents with [something],
		but [-4] was given for the comparison size.

assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> for_using_double_constraints_with_assert_that 
	Constraints of double type, such as [equal double],
		should only be used with 'assert_that_double()' to ensure proper comparison.

assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> for_using_double_constraints_with_assert_that 
	Expected [3] to [equal double] [3.1415926]

assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> for_using_double_constraints_with_assert_that 
	Constraints of double type, such as [be less than double],
		should only be used with 'assert_that_double()' to ensure proper comparison.

assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> for_using_double_constraints_with_assert_that 
	Constraints of double type, such as [be greater than double],
		should only be used with 'assert_that_double()' to ensure proper comparison.

assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> for_using_double_constraints_with_assert_that 
	Expected [7] to [be greater than double] [3.1415926]

assertion_messages_tests.c: Failure: AssertionMessage -> return_value_constraints_are_not_allowed 
	Got constraint of type [return value],
		but they are not allowed for assertions, only in mock expectations.
